    <!-- Instructions
    
        Starting from a blank HTML file, create an array with 10 question objects. Each object in the array should be structured as follows:
    { q: "QUESTION", a: "ANSWER" }
    
    Then create code that will ask the user questions, one by one. The user must answer by hitting OK (for true) or Cancel (for false).
    
    Check the user's answer against the correct answer, and provide them with an alert telling them if they are right or wrong.

    BONUS: Keep track of the user's score. -->
